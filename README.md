## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartedu-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

      cd smartedu-app

Install the required dependencies:


      npm install

### Database Configuration

The application uses a MongoDB database for data storage. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running locally or provide a remote database URL.

In the app.js file, you can configure the MongoDB connection by modifying the mongoose.connect line:



    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/smartedu-db').then(() => {
    console.log('DB connected successfully.');
    });

Replace 'mongodb://localhost/smartedu-db' with your own MongoDB connection URL.
Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:

    npm start

The server will start, and you'll see a message in the console:

    app started on port 3000

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.


The SmartEdu application provides various features related to educational content, course management, user authentication, and more. Refer to the project's specific documentation or codebase to learn more about each feature.
